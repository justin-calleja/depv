Install globally with:

```
$ npm i -g @justinc/depv
```

Run in a directory containing a package.json file (or one in which a parent dir contains a package.json file):

```
$ depv
```

Note: `node_modules` must be installed for it to work. Error handling is not implemented. This is just example code for a yet to be published blog post.
